Plugin to play a sound when starting/stopping
streaming/recording.

===WINDOWS===
Windows is built and working for both 32bit and 64bit
Has all required .dlls

Drag and drop obs-studio folder into C:\Program Files
(or wher ever you have obs-studio installed)
Merge all files down and you should be good to go.

===LINUX===
I provide binaries for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64bit for the PPA
version of OBS
Just run
	>make install
and it should install for you in the right places.

=For others=, compile and install with
	>make
	>make install
		#NOTE# make install may not work. See below.
Dependancies:
obs (duh)
ffmpeg (you should have this if you have a working obs)
SDL2 (Simple Directmedia Layer, see https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)

I've provided a best guess for make install. If your files
are set up how I think they will be, put SRBeep-bin into
the obs-studio folder, uncomment the bottom secion and
comment out the install: and clean: bits that aren't
commented.

You'll probably have to move the .so.## for ffmpeg into
/usr/lib/
but obs-studio should throw a warning for each .so.## (one at a
time) when it tries to load the module to tell you what they are.
They should be in the ffmpeg/lib folder (where ever that may be
for you)

===MAC===
Uh, sould work. Probably. Don't have a MAC to test with.
So...
You can try the "For others" bit of LINUX
Let me know if you get it to work!
